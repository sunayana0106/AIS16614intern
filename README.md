4. Selection in dataframes : row or column selection, delete, update, index, remove index, etc. operations betweeen two rows or columns in dataframe
5. Missing values : checking for missing values, dropping missing values, fill missing value

# Day 6 task
1. Matplot library for visulisations : scatter plot, line plot, histogram, pie chart,etc. customization in this plots like colour,size, legends,etc.
2. Seaborn library: Seaborn is a library that uses Matplotlib underneath to plot graphs.

# Day 7 task
We solve the exercise on the Ecommerce , Salary dataset taken from Kaggle.
Also solved the NumPy exercise using the methods and libraries learned in previous tasks.

# Case study
Conducted case study on titanic dataset taken from Kaggel
read data and import necessary libraries in jupyter
  ## data preprocessing : 
1. find missing value ,fill or drop
2. if need drop variable 
3. label encoding for categorical variable
  ## Data visualisations:
  ## Model building:
1.choose dependent and independent variables
2.split data into train test ,80:20
3.import naive bay’s algorithms 
4.fit naive bays model, knn model, decision tree on train data
5.predict text data using fitted model
  ## Model evaluation: adequecy of model using different scores
1. find accuracy
2. find classification report 
3. find confusion matrics
 ## Comparison:
Compair all models on basis of Accuracy,recall, precision

# Dashboard
 Power BI software is used to analyze and to create dashboard on customer churn analysis dataset
 we get different insights from the dashboard analysis.
 
# Final Project
Topic: OTT Customer Churn Analysis

About The Topic/ Dataset:
OTT services provide users with an alternative source for content that is normally only available through a cable or satellite provider. They also offer a cost-effective way to access content, often eliminating the need for expensive contracts and monthly fees. OTT services typically require users to sign up for an account, either through a website or an app, and then they can access the content they desire. 
Subscriber churn is a critical issue for companies that rely on recurring revenue from subscription-based services like the OTT platform.
Churn analysis is the use of customer data to understand why they stopped using the service. Higher the churn rate, the ,more users, and revenue, the company is losing

Variable Description :
Age : Can be used to understand age-related trends in customer retention.
Gender : The gender of the customer 
Tenure : The no. of months customer has been with company
Usage frequency : How often the customer uses service (eg. Daily, weekly, monthly)
Support calls : The no. of times customer has called support
Payment delay : No. of days customer is late in making payments.
Subscription type : Type of subscription the customer has (eg. Basic, Premium, Standard)
Contract length : Duration of contract.
Total spend : The total amount of money customer spent.
Last interaction : The date or time since the customer’s last interacted with the service.
Churn : The target variable that indicates whether a customer has left the service, crucial for building predictive models.

 ## data preprocessing : 
1. find missing value ,fill or drop
2. if need drop variable 
3. label encoding for categorical variable
 ## Data visualisations:
 ## Model building:
1.choose dependent and independent variables
2.split data into train test ,80:20
3.Use different algorithms to fit the different models to classify the dependent variable.
4.Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, knn, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Bagging Meta estimator, MLP classifier, XGBooster classifier, Stacking classifier
5.Models are compared using Accuracy, Precision, recall.
6.to obtain best model with best parameters using GridSearchCV
7.Reduce Data dimension using feature importancen in decision tree and build different model on this variables
 ## Model evaluation: adequecy of model using different scores
1. find accuracy
2. find classification report 
3. find confusion matrics
   ## Conclusions:
1.By feature importance the key variables to classify customer churn are Support calls, Total spend, Age, Payment Delay, Contract length.
2.In knn algorithm  model acquires highest accuracy and precision after GridSearchCV with best parameters.
Gradient Booster classifier model gives highest precision when fitted with important variables only.
In knn algorithm  model acquires highest precision after GridSearchCV with best parameters when fitted with important variables only..
